Biochemie for Dummies

## To Do
- implement options for specifying which processing functions to run and with which parameters (ex. calculate angles, calculate distances for n=5) (control flow group)
- limit option parameter for distance calculaion to odd numbers (control flow group)
- implement function for retrieving file paths (parser group)
- implement function for parsing protein data from one file (parser group)
- implement function for parsing data for ALL protein files (parser group)
- implement protein, amino acid, and atom structs (???)
- implement functions for allocating and deallocating memory (every group that uses it)
- implement nGram struct (distance and angle groups)
- implement a function for generating an array of nGrams for a given protein (distance and angle groups)
- implement function for finding ngram centers               (distance group)
- implement function for finding the distance between 2 nGrams  (distance group)
- implement function for finding distances between ALL nGrams (distance group)
- implement function for finding angles for a 6Gram (angle group)
- implement functions for outputting all processed data (maybe write to file)
- write tests (control group)

## Guidelines
- use descriptive names for functions and variables
- all functions should have a comment decribing what it does
- use english
